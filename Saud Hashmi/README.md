# Super-Mario-JS

The goal of this project is to basically introduce participants to the
basic structure of how a game works internally. What kind of logics are required to create the games we played since childhood. We will be using JavaScript and HTML Canvas to create a 2D Super Mario game, so that we can freely play the game in our browsers.

## Tasks completed

- There is a coordinates.js file in the assets/Map folder which contains the coordinates for our background objects and entities, make changes to the coordinates and create your own custom level in the game.
- ✅ Change the input options of the game, instead of using arrow keys, try incooperating other keys such as S,W,A,D to move around.
- ✅ Alter the Physics file with your custom speed of Mario and other entities, also you can change the gravity aspects.
- You will be taught how to code for few of the entities of the Entity folder, rest will be done by you.
